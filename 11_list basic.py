# list in python is used to store multiple data: data could be names,digits, or letters
# In list the data would be stored in square brackets [] and data should be seperated by coma

# listing names
name = ['sunday','monday','tuesday','wednesday','tursday','friday']

# printint name
print('list will be displayed along with coma and brackets\n')
print(name)

# python will print the list along with coma's and bracket which is not really necessary
